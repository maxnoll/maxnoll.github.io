# Zotero Styles
Below, in the hope that they will be useful to others, are some Zotero styles I have created for my publications. Note that they are drafty, may not cover all cases, and are of course for you to use at your own risk.
### HJIL/ZaöRV - Heidelberg Journal of International Law/Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht
Books, Articles and Book Chapters should work properly. The style is based on the OSCOLA style by [Sebastian Karcher](https://www.sebastiankarcher.com/) and published under the [CC BY-SA 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).
